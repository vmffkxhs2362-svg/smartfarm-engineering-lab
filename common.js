We are planning to optimize the energy efficiency of our greenhouse facility and would like to request a non-binding quotation for the delivery and installation of a thermal/energy screening system.

Below are the technical specifications for our facility:
- Greenhouse Envelope Surface Area: ${formattedArea}
- Cladding Material: ${coverMaterialName} (U-value: ${uValue} W/m²·K)
- Design Maximum Heating Load (Without Screen): ${peakLoad.toFixed(1)} kW
- Requested Screen Type: ${screenName}
- Estimated Peak Load Reduction: ${savingsLoad.toFixed(1)} kW

Please provide us with estimated lead times for the screening materials, along with a rough cost estimate for the installation. We are available for further technical discussions or clarifications.

Best regards,
[Your Name / Company]`;
